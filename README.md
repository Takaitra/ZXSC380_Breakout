This is a breadboard-friendly breakout board for the ZXSC380 LED driver. This repository contains the Eagle design files. You will also need to install the [Takaitra Eagle library](https://github.com/Takaitra/Takaitra-Eagle-Libraries). This breakout board is used in my [tutorial on designing and building an SMD breakout board](https://www.takaitra.com/design-build-smd-breakout-board/).
